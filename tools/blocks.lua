File Generated from:
luajit conv_blocks.lua ..\ucdsource\Blocks.txt > blocks.lua

If you want to make modifications to this file, you should generate it again.

This file is a convenience, converting from the unicode character database Blocks.txt file
to a format that is more convenient for manipulation within lua.  
First, it is a lua table.
Second, the planeNumber field, and a block number within that plane have been calculated.
The BlockNumber is purely sequential based on the in order traversal of the file, and 
resetting to 0 when crossing across planes.  As new blocks can be introduced, this is not
to be taken as an immutable field, but merely informational.

These might be used in other places to build up a rapid character lookup table.
